## Interview
Hello!  Please answer the questions below in a few sentences at the least.

Q1: What is the biggest challenge facing new developers and how can they prepare for it?
* _Jeremy_:  Good question.  I think the biggest challenge for new Java developers is the sheer size of the ecosystem.  It's a pretty mature development environment and half of the battle is knowing what's already available at your disposal.  I think the best way to prepare is perhaps to talk to more senior developers.  Maybe I should change my answer, lol:  The biggest challenge is being afraid to ask for help.  Spinning your wheels for days trying to do something is problematic.  Reach out to coworkers for help... establish a relationship so that you're not afraid to ask for help, but be sure to go to that person with what you've done so far so they can assess where you're at and where you need to be unstuck.

Q2: What do you like to do in your spare time? 
* _Jeremy_: Spare time is hard to come by.  However, first and foremost would be traveling.  Of course I need vacation time to do that, so on a smaller scale I like to play board games with family and friends.

Q3: What is your favorite travel destination?
* _Jeremy_:  My favorite so far has been France (Paris in particular).  I love Europe, and experiencing the cultures.  Florence was also a highlight.  David is amazing in person (the most impressive artwork I've seen in person).
